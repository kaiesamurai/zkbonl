# Research Process Leading to Project Design

## Overview

The design of Provehance was informed by a comprehensive research process aimed at understanding the needs, preferences, and pain points of potential users in both traditional finance (Web2) and blockchain environments (Web3). The research process encompassed various elements such as Empathy Maps, Customer Personas, Customer Scenarios, and Storyboards to ensure a user-centric approach to product development.

## Empathy Maps

Empathy maps were created to gain insights into the thoughts, feelings, and motivations of potential users when interacting with financial services and blockchain technology. By understanding their emotions, pain points, and aspirations, we were able to empathize with their experiences and design solutions that address their specific needs effectively.

## Customer Personas

Customer personas were developed to represent fictional users with diverse backgrounds, goals, challenges, and needs. These personas helped us visualize and understand the different user segments and tailor our product features and functionalities to meet their requirements effectively. By empathizing with the personas, we were able to design a platform that resonates with the target audience and adds value to their financial management processes.

## Customer Scenarios

Customer scenarios were created to illustrate how potential users would interact with Provehance in real-life situations to address their financial needs. These scenarios provided valuable insights into the specific use cases and pain points of users, allowing us to design intuitive workflows and user interfaces that streamline their experience and enhance usability.

## Figma Design for Website

In line with the detailed assumptions and design choices made for Provehance, we embarked on creating a comprehensive Figma design for the website. Leveraging the insights gathered from empathy maps, customer personas, and customer scenarios, we meticulously crafted wireframes and visual designs that reflect the user-centric approach and aesthetic preferences outlined in our research process. The Figma design served as a pivotal tool in translating our conceptual ideas into tangible visual elements, allowing us to iteratively refine and improve the user experience based on feedback and testing. By embracing Figma as our design platform, we ensured alignment with our research findings and provided a solid foundation for the development of a user-friendly and visually appealing website for Provehance.
