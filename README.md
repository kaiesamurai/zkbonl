# ZKBonk Overview

## What is ZKBonk?

ZKBonk is an innovative platform combining Open Banking with blockchain technology to enable users to generate verifiable financial proofs without compromising privacy. Through an API, users can securely link their bank data to a blockchain-based zk-proof system, issuing Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) as proof of financial status. These proofs include reserves, transaction authenticity, creditworthiness, and more.
